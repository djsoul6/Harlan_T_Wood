         Harlan is a very competent project manager. He is detail oriented and doesn't let
         anything fall through the cracks. He is proactive in getting his people together to
         have those tough conversations. Harlan is very much an advocate of transparency and
         is able to report the appropriate level of information to the right people, so they
         in turn can stay on the pulse of the project. Harlan has been fantastic to work with
         and I would be honored to work with him on a project again.

         Harlan's positive and friendly attitude combined with his experience with agile development
         practices make him a great team member on critical, time-sensitive projects. As a
         developer, his decision making process always focuses first on delivering business
         value, and keeping the team on track to 
         <span class="attention">deliver quality, tested software</span>
         He introduced many agile practices at Wireless Generation, leading the creation of
         the infrastructure and test cases for automated web acceptance tests. Aware of the
         challenges faced in 
         <span class="attention">introducing change</span>
         Harlan created 
         <span class="attention">highly visible project metrics</span>
         to keep product owners constantly informed of story progress and code quality. His
         friendly personality and creative energy always made pairing sessions fun, and I'd
         welcome the chance to work with him again.

      <div class="testimonialText">Harlan was a progressive force in the company, promoting agile practices and <span class="attention">helping us improve the way we made software</span>. Harlan quickly developed an automated build process; In retrospect I don't know
         how we got by without an automated build. He set up code metrics, promoted unit tests,
         and a concern for developing high quality software. More than anything, Harlan brings
         a <span class="attention">passion for developing software the right way</span>.

         developer, and a pleasure to work with. His <span class="attention"> considered, lateral and focused approach to his work is a true asset, </span> as is his ability to communicate very effectively.  We were sad to see him leave
         to return to the US. I have no hesitation in recommending Harlan to any organization
         seeking a developer, and person, of very high quality.
