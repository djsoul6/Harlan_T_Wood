        Harlan is a very competent project manager. He is detail oriented and doesn't let anything fall through the cracks. He is proactive in getting his people together to have those tough conversations. Harlan is very much an advocate of transparency and is able to report the appropriate level of information to the right people, so they in turn can stay on the pulse of the project. Harlan has been fantastic to work with and I would be honored to work with him on a project again.

    <testimonialUnedited>I worked with Harlan for about 18 months at Wireless Generation. During that time Harlan was a progressive force in the company, promoting agile practices and helping us improve the way we made software. Harlan quickly saw the need for and developed an automated build process. In retrospect I don't know how we got by without an automated build, but at the time there was some skepticism. He set up code metric and other tools. He promoted unit tests and a concern for developing high quality software in a modern sense. And of course he producing high quality applications. More than anything, Harlan brings a passion for developing software the right way.</testimonialUnedited>

    <testimonialUnedited>Harlan's intelligence, professionalism, talent and genuine interest in software development - not to mention his warmth, wit, and consideration for others - make him an excellent developer, and a pleasure to work with. His considered, lateral and focused approach to his work is a true asset, as is his ability to communicate very effectively. We were sad to see him leave to return to the US. I have no hesitation in recommending Harlan to any organisation seeking a developer, and person, of very high quality.</testimonialUnedited>
