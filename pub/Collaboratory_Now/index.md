The Core Nexus
--------------

I've been putting together a document called "Core Nexus" recently, which gathers the best practices I know of from several bodies of work, linking directly to the systems and processes that are the luminous operational cores of each system.  A sample:

> **Team Level**: [Core Protocols](http://liveingreatness.com/files/core-protocols-3.03.html) or better
> 
> **Organization Level**: [Holacracy](http://www.holacracy.org/sites/default/files/resources/holacracy_constitution_v3.0_0.pdf) or better
>     
> **Sharing Credit & Wealth**: [Better Means](http://bettermeans.com/front/open_enterprise_governance_model.html) or better                   


Collaborate: fork, diff, merge
------------------------------

OK, a bit of context here.  I wrote a post recently asking [What if we checked the commons into GitHub?](http://www.harlantwood.net/pub/What_if_We_Checked_the_Commons_into_Github/index.html)

So naturally, I am authoring this "Core Nexus" document in Github,  as I believe it to be a prime candidate for remixing -- ie we need luminous cores, for all our fractal collaboration groups and organizations, and we want gather, curate, and remix each others' collections of best practices.

You can see the rendered document on Github here:   <https://github.com/harlantwood/The_Project/blob/master/Core_Nexus.markdown>

Here is what the markdown source that generates the document looks like:   <https://raw.github.com/harlantwood/The_Project/master/Core_Nexus.markdown>

If you want to try editing / remixing, I *highly* recommend [prose.io](http://prose.io/), which connects directly to your github account (which is free, dead simple signup in 15 seconds).

To test this concept (please do!): 
  
1. create a github account
2. go here <https://github.com/harlantwood/The_Project/blob/master/Core_Nexus.markdown> and click the Edit button. 

This will fork the repository for you, and let you change it as you wish.  As an example, here are the additions that +Glistening Deepwater made in her fork: <https://github.com/Glisten/The_Project/compare/4f7957a...66d70f6>

Why Not Facebook?
-----------------

I am personally getting pretty fed up with our collective 
[scenius](http://www.kk.org/thetechnium/archives/2008/06/scenius_or_comm.php) leaking out in 
dribbles across hundreds of Facebook threads that are subsequently unfindable unless they are 
indexed in 
[Zaq Mosher's google docs](https://docs.google.com/folder/d/0B5PC4hPnRiAYWUpkQmRkOEUwN1k/edit?pli=1) 
{sad face}.  

I also have major concerns about the ownership of the IP generated in FB.     

[ToS;DR (Terms of Service; Didn't Read)](http://tos-dr.info/) has this to say about Facebook's 
"very broad copyright license on your content":

> The copyright license that you grant to Facebook goes beyond the requirements for operating the 
> service. For instance, it includes the right for Facebook to transfer the license or to license > > it others on their terms (“sublicense”). Also, the copyright license does not end when you stop 
> using the service unless your content has been deleted by everyone else.

Following their "discussion" link took me to [Hugo Roy](http://hugoroy.eu/index.en.html) 
recapitulating Facebook's copyright license: 

> You grant us a non-exclusive, transferable, sub-licensable, 
> royalty-free, worldwide license to use any IP content that you 
> post on or in connection with Facebook (IP License). 

So. Lets make our great works elsewhere.

Collaboratory Now
-----------------

From Wikipedia:

> A collaboratory, as defined by William Wulf in 1989, is a “center without walls, in which the nation’s researchers can perform their research without regard to physical location, interacting with colleagues, accessing instrumentation, sharing data and computational resources, and accessing information in digital libraries” 

[Zaq Mosher](https://plus.google.com/117732747303095811637/posts) and friends are working on one: <http://www.facebook.com/collaboratori>

[Venessa Miemis](http://emergentbydesign.com/) and friends (including myself) were working in one, now mostly dormant: <https://collaboratory.atlassian.net/>

Venessa also wrote about the concept in her post [Intentcasting an Epic Vision: How to Bootstrap Creative Economy 3.0](http://emergentbydesign.com/2012/01/16/intentcasting-an-epic-vision-how-to-bootstrap-creative-economy-3-0/).  Some excerpts:

> **Collaboratory**
>
> “systems intelligence & innovation design lab + global foresight commons (a Wikipedia for Getting *Shift* Done)”
>
> This is our backroom playspace. Think of it like the artisan’s workshop. If you become a patron of the creative process, you get access to the inner workings. 
>
> This is also where the private community (the Emergence Collective) works on stuff together. You can check out the status of projects, see new projects/business ventures forming in the incubator, and see the bleeding edge tech and innovation research we’re conducting. Check out sketches and UI mockups that the design team are working on. 
>
> Also building out an API & IP Commons with the hacker teams in our community. They’ll be able to share code and give visibility to each others’ projects so they can accelerate their initiatives. We favor open source, but all are welcome.
>
> The Collaboratory is essentially an engine of co-creation combined with a Commons. You bring in your community of practice, set up shop in your own ‘global space’ area, and set permissions for what is visible, shareable, or private.
>
> The metaphor we’ve been using to conceptualize it is Storefront / Cafe / Backroom. 
>
> **Storefront:**
>
> This is like the Macy’s window from the street. It’s your showcase of the “best of” what’s inside. Public-facing view of your projects and ventures.
>
> **Cafe:**
>
> This is your shop. Just like stores have rules to enter (“no shirt, no shoes, no service), there are permissions to be granted to enter the shop. (ie – referral via trust network, sign NDA, whatever terms you set. it’s your space.)
>
> **Backroom:**
>
> This is the creator’s workshop. Deepest level of access permissions. Maybe it’s just your core team and your workflow management. Maybe it’s where you invite potential collaborators or investors to check out your big picture vision. It might be a bit chaotic, but it’s where the magic happens.

Let's Get Forking
-----------------

Github is just one option.  We can (and probably should) have an entire ecosystem of collaboratories, utilizing the strengths of each, and sharing collaborations between systems as desired.  The downside of github seems to be that it's a bit intimidating for non-programmers, even though the [actual mechanics of using it are now quite simple and streamlined](https://github.com/harlantwood/The_Project/blob/master/Collaborating-Like-a-Hacker.markdown).  The upside is that it's ready now.  No programming of new systems required.  Get an account and be collaborating 30 seconds from now.
