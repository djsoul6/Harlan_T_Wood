Not all of the commons, mind you,  and not all at once. But each of our little slices of this vast wealth, our areas of interest, that which we wish to share, to curate, and to remix.

Why should programmers have a monopoly on the paradigm shifting technologies and new information topologies known to the open source software world as forking, diffing, and merging?

I'll say it again,  because I'm not kidding.  I'm not making a rhetorical point.

_What if we checked the commons into GitHub?_      

## Open Source Everything

What if in our collaborations around open hardware designs, open corporate systems, open government models, open solutions to our biggest challenges -- what if we could fork each other's content and offer these changes back to the original authors, just as programmers can today with GitHub's pull requests?

What is the commons were a space of global-scale remixing, a living symphony, a thriving ecosystem of creativity and innovation, built on a substrate of proliferation and organic evolution?

We can have this now.

[GitHub](https://github.com/) has built and refined a base suite of high quality tools.  All that remains is to:

1. Crawl your trust network, gathering creative commons (or similarly licensed) content from the sites of interest to you.

2. HTML is painful to diff and merge -- so strip the content down to plain text, or a same format like markdown.

3. Curate your content collections -- this could be as simple as a blog post announcing a new collection of remixable content.

4. Invite others to collaborate.  The commons should be a space for creative play.   

One and two I'm working on, in the context of a project called [Software Zero](http://enlightenedstructure.org/Software_Zero/) -- currently pre-alpha and fit only for ruby coders.  [Contact me](https://github.com/harlantwood) if you want to play.  Three and four are dead easy.

## It's not just GitHub

While GitHub would love this, and is the most appropriate current platform that I know of, there are other serious players appearing in the fork/diff/merge space.  Most notably, Ward Cunningham, inventor of Wiki, has released a new open source [Federated Wiki](https://github.com/WardCunningham/Smallest-Federated-Wiki#readme) (biased author alert: I did a bunch of work on this project).  A key excerpt from a [Wired article](http://www.wired.com/wiredenterprise/2012/07/wiki-inventor/) on FedWiki:

> Cunningham’s vision is that you will have your own wiki, perhaps several wikis. When you see a page on someone else’s federated wiki that you want to edit, you can click "fork," and the page is copied into your own wiki where you can edit it. The owner of the original wiki can then decide whether to merge your changes into the original page.

## Coming soon to a planet near you                                                                             

The commons is actually just a start, a perfect seed crystal to spark the remix revolution. Once distributed workgroups of all kinds have tasted this technological edge, there is no return to the flat earth topology of 20th century collaboration.
