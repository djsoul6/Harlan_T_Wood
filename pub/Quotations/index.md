> I'm interested in large scale systems with distributed control. I take my inspiration from economics, politics, language, learning, culture and, of course, life itself. I'm most satisfied when I write software that borrows from such systems. I'm working on a distributed architecture that favors robustness over correctness. If you think you will miss correctness, consider these questions from the fields I mention:  
> What is the price of bread?  
> How are decisions made in a democracy?  
> Who puts meaning in metaphor?  
> What limits storage in a neural network?  
> Are folk tales true?

> -- [Ward Cunningnam]

> "The future is open source everything."
